   Hello and thank you for this opportunity. 
                                                I enjoyed every second of it.

                                                  How to start application:

    1. Type $ pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal then press then "enter" key. This will install the required packages for this application to run.

    2. The "mysite" outer-parent directory contains a python file called "manage.py" that starts the application. Access this 
    outer-parent directory with your terminal. Then type the command $ python manage.py runserver and press the "enter" key. 
    (In your terminal type $ cd mysite then press the "enter" key. Then type the command $ python manage.py runserver then press the "enter" key)

                                                      How to run tests:
    1. Once again you must use your terminal to access the "mysite" outer-parent directory. Once you access it, in order to run the first test file, you
    must run the following command: $ python manage.py test hatchway.Tests.views_test_case 
    This command: $ python manage.py test hatchway.Tests.posts_provider_test_case is for the second test file.

    port: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

    run command: In your terminal type $ cd mysite then press the "enter" key. Then type the command $ python manage.py runserver then press the "enter" key

    install command: $ pip install -r requirements.txt

    posts_provider_test_case command: $ python manage.py test hatchway.Tests.posts_provider_test_case
    views_test_case command: $ python manage.py test hatchway.Tests.views_test_case

    language: Python(Django)
