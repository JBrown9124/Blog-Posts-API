                                          Hello and thank you for this opportunity. 
                                                I enjoyed every second of it.

                                                  How to start application:

    1. Activate my .venv located in the root folder of my application or install the packages I used into your virtual environment.
    If you go to the requirements.txt file in my root folder you will see all the packages that are required for this application to run.

    2. The "mysite" outer-parent directory contains a python file called "manage.py" that starts the application. Access this 
    outer-parent directory with your terminal. Then type the command $ python manage.py runserver and press the "enter" key. 
    (In your terminal type $ cd mysite then press the "enter" key. Then type the command $ python manage.py runserver then press the "enter" key)

                                                      How to run tests:
    1. Once again you must use your terminal to access the "mysite" outer-parent directory. Once you access it, in order to run the first test file, you
    must run the following command: $ python manage.py test hatchway.Tests.views_test_case 
    This command: $ python manage.py test hatchway.Tests.posts_provider_test_case is for the second test file.

    port: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

    run command: In your terminal type $ cd mysite then press the "enter" key. Then type the command $ python manage.py runserver then press the "enter" key

    install command: $ pip install -r requirements.txt
